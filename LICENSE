ATTRIBUTION

This MCP server wraps and reuses code from Agent Zero:
https://github.com/agent0ai/agent-zero

Files derived from Agent Zero (with minimal modifications):
- helpers/tty_session.py (unchanged)
- helpers/shell_local.py (added executable parameter)
- helpers/print_style.py (changed log directory)
- helpers/strings.py (removed files dependency)
- code_execution_tool.py (removed agent dependencies, preserved all core logic)
- prompts/*.md (unchanged)

All credit for the battle-tested code execution implementation goes to the
Agent Zero team.
